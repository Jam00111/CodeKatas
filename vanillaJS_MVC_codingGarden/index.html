    <p>
      This App was built on vanilla JS with no frameworks for the purpose of learning more about JS and why frameworks are useful. </br>
      It has Components with a MVC set up, routes, and connects to an API </br>
      It is able to addComponent, showComponent, and updateView </br>
      Each component has a Model, View, and a Controller to manage the data, data retrieval, and data view. </br>
      The Router allows it to add a route, and utilizes onHashChange to swap out components </br>
      The API just reaches out to a free api source for info on breweries </br>
      In conclusion.... Should you do this in PROD? Absolutely not. </br>
      Frameworks exist for a reason. Coding this from scratch is time consuming, and the added value of better and more efficient testing and security far outways any percieved benefit of doing this in vanilla JS </br>
      However, doing this for fun or learning? Yes. </br>
      If you were to implement a library/framework/api feature from scratch, how would you do it?</br>
      When you're using a framework, consider how was it implented? Always remember the first principals and best practices when coding. Any code you write will be used/enhanced/bugfixed/etc... by someone who is not you.
